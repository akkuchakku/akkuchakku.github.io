                            <p class="lead2 mt-4">For this task, we were to create a 'flashback' scene. We decided to open with a person trapped in a locked room, then have a flashback implying that they were being followed. Then after the flashback, it is revealed that this paranoia was fabricated by the character, and they had been in the room for mundane reasons, being locked in by accident. As we had no access to sound recording equipment for this excercise (beyond the camera's built in recorder), we elected to focus on shot types and visual storytelling.</p>

                            <p>Dark clouds rolled overhead, Aurelius wrapped his cloak closer around his shoulders. From the outpost, he watched workers leave the fields and stream in through the town gates. A spear and helmet lay against the parapet, they wouldnâ€™t be too useful tonight. The storms were growing more frequent and as the days passed, so was the gnawing dread creeping at the edges of his thoughts. He turned in towards the township. Its streets were empty, save for the few couriers carrying urgent news and soldiers rounding up the homeless to take them to some kind of shelter. Once, he would have been angry. But the fire, the obsession to see justice served, that had driven him to the height of the Verdant Council had long since abandoned him. No depth of passion could fight the wrath of nature itself, he thought. The city-folk had abandoned the Wastes to the consequences that they had caused. </p>
