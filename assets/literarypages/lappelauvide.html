                            <strong>Synopsis</strong>
                            <br>This story is a supernatural drama, which follows Noah, the self-assured police chief in Ash Grove, who is called in to the station to find his 17-year-old daughter, Lena has been arrested for breaking into the local church with a group of seniors. This turns out to be the culmination of Lena’s gradual turn to social activism, a decision that Noah believes she needs to be “protected” from. Noah dismisses her concerns, that the church has been covering up abuse, but lets the kids go, opposed to punishing them so severely. He meets with the head pastor Davis, who warns him that if he cannot discipline his daughter, then he will make sure the law will. Davis then gives Noah an absurd alternative. The church plans to summon their God the following night and have him set the world back in order by revealing his perfect morality to everyone. Noah wants to believe the pastor, desperate for any chance to “save” Lena, but he isn’t completely convinced.<br> The next day, Noah takes Lena to a lookout to do some photography. He tries to talk to Lena about her actions, but things get heated, and he comes off as dismissive and condescending. With his daughter doubling down on her defiance, he turns to his last alternative. In the evening, Noah arrives at the church where the clergy is waiting in anticipation. Instead of Davis, another pastor begins the sermon. He preaches for some time about the encroachment of “social degeneracy” and the virtuous nature of his audience, riling up the crowd to a frenzy. Then, the clergy begins the ritual, as Noah warily follows along. As the chanting rises to a crescendo, everything goes dark, and each person is pulled into a vision. <br> Noah floats in a sea of darkness. He has no indication of where he is. Visions of random peoples’ lives begin to materialise in the distance, growing closer and closer. They are layered upon each other, and Noah doesn’t just see their lives, but he shares each one of their emotions and their senses. It’s almost as if he is experiencing millions of lives simultaneously. He is overwhelmed by all these conflicting experiences and emotions. <br> Pulled back to reality, Noah wakes to see the church on fire. Everyone around him seems to have lost their minds. Noah runs out of the collapsing church and runs into Davis. Davis tries, unconvincingly, to reassure Noah that this was meant to happen, but Noah angrily challenges his sincerity. Lena calls, worried, and Noah is unable to be honest with her, struggling to fit the visions he saw into his restrictive worldview. But she convinces him to trust her, and he learns to show more vulnerability with her, finally acknowledging her maturity.
