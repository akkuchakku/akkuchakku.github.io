                            This narrative has evolved over a long peroid of time, initially beginning as a series of bullet points I had written about a boy stealing a knight's mythical armour to gain external validation and appear heroic. I was inspired by the exact artwork used as the thumnail for this page, by (@simz.art), which gave me a clearer picture of who some of my main characters were and eventually developed into a broader short story which I submitted as a uni major work. Thoughts about this story stuck with me over the December break as I added worldbuilding and plot points to parts of the existing story, weaving in threads and fragments of unimplemented ideas and pieces of other large stories I had brainstormed, but never felt satisfied with enough to ink on paper. Within the course of a few months I had a stable foundation for a sweeping fantasy world built in ink and moltar, where marine life drifted through the air and where the sky had a ceiling and the sun was an inverted volcano. I had built a complex magic system which seamlessly emerged from the natural environment, and developed my old characters into more complex personalities.
                            <br>At this point, I owed it to myself to at least make an attempt at writing this narrative, so I decided to commit to submitting the opening pages of <i>The Inkswept Citadel</i> for two uni courses simultaneously, to force myself to start. Often the biggest challenge to the introduction of an epic fantasy is to draw in the reader with an effective hook, while at the same time teaching them about the basic details of the story world. When explaining the world, the writer must set a clear tone, effectively outline the border between the ordinary and fantastical world and point out key features that define the story world, while at the same time (at least for my specific application of epic fantasy), narrating from the mind of a character who already is familiar with this world and doesn’t need most of this explained to them. Additionally, fantasy writers have to situate their narrative in place and time without the assistance of any real-life context clues.
                            <br>
                            <br>Soon after writing a quick draft I began making changes and revisions. Through an introduction of a prologue, I was able to communicate a sense of a world with a dense history and portray a scene where all my major fantastical elements would interact with each other. The prologue can also now match the darker tone suggested by the fantastical “ink” in this world. Another key feature of the prologue is that it provides a direct, first-hand account of a historical event, Pralayehena, that is in the narrative present, shrouded in mystery. Now readers will start to question any account of Pralayehena which doesn’t seem to match what they already, and this dissonance between the past and present can function as a hook that lasts well into the greater story. We can see an example of this early on, when the protagonist Ivo recounts a legend about the Dreadknights saving the city of Yvanthryl, she brings up mention of a Naga monster which is noticeably absent from the prologue. 
                            <br>
                            <br>After my first workshopping, I received a consistent amount of feedback on clarity and pacing, where many people felt as though there were parts of my story which could be read as either literally fantastical or metaphorically ordinary. People also felt as though the prologue began too slowly and the main story was too fast. In terms of clarity, I decided to leave out some more figurative description from the start, and always be literal when introducing magical elements, such as the Ink or the moment when an Alchemist wields fire. I also increased my rate of revelation, where I provided more details about the function of ink (while still leaving out the way it does what it does to keep intrigue) to make it seem more like a functioning part of the world, and added details about a sickness, the Withering, as an obvious justification behind the anger of the Prydeshah. In order to fix the pacing, a number of people had explained that the strongest part of the prologue was when the narration was focalised through the Inkworker, so I decided to introduce her much earlier on in the narrative to help audiences engage with the narrative through human connection much earlier on. Then for the main story, I added quite a bit of setting description, allowing me to further characterise the town of Solyn and more explicitly define the physical environment in which the characters are interacting. With these changes I was also able to introduce a number of new materials and features unique to this world like rosin, cinderash and kelp forests. With the second workshopping, most people agreed that the story world felt more real with a better sense of progression, and now gave me specific line edits. 
                            <br>
                            <br>Another major change made between my initial idea of the narrative and the final work, was a complete rework to Ivo’s actions and motivations, which in turn, majorly changed the story after Ivo gets the Dreadknight’s armour. Initially Ivo’s actions were motivated through self-preservation, where she wears the armour against her mentor’s advice to save the city, then leaves the city because she is being pursued by agents of the Divine and attempts to frame one of the raiders to absolve her of possessing the armour. I made some changes to this, where Ivo now acts to save the raiders from her village guardsmen, motivated by empathy and compassion and her own values rather than external pressures, as not only does she become a more likable character, but her now proactive character is more engaging and effective at drawing readers in. Unfortunately, the narrative does not yet reach the story where she directly saves the Hanlen people, but the seeds for this character beat exist within the current text.
                            <br>
                            <br>Since these revisions and a subsequent submission, I have made a decent number of small edits and revisions to this text, and continued on the story for another few scenes.
