                            <p class="lead mt-4">This photo essay was inspired by, and is about a trip to Tasmania that I went on with my friends. We spent a significant portion of this trip, on various walks/hikes such as Cradle Mountain, and the sights we saw here were what made the trip especially memorable. The story focuses on showcasing the immensity of the world around us, in an attempt to encourage the viewer to recall feelings of wonder or awe that they feel when exploring the vastness of nature. This production centres primarily around the photo of the milky way, that I captured on my phone in a dark area near our lodge on Cradle Mountain. The production process was fairly simple: I started by writing and recording a script, while simultaneously marking photos from my camera roll to use later. Then after stitching the voiceover together, I added the photos and some sound from videos that I had taken. For some images, I decided to make them move across the screen or zoom in and out in order to better reflect the spoken narrative and keep things different and interesting. The “climax” of the story however, was initially empty so I used a score editing program (Musescore) to quickly throw together a short piano and synth track, to accompany this section. The main challenge regarding the production of this piece was realising that I lacked a large enough variety of photos to appropriately accompany the different parts of the script, or to provide sufficient variety. This issue was especially prominent for my night photos, all of my pictures were of the stars (including many failed ones) and I had no photos of me or my friends walking through the dark, or taking photos or doing anything. The best way I found to circumvent this issue was to find other photos in my albums that were similar to the events that I was narrating, including photos that were years older and were completely unrelated to the Tasmania trip and use them instead. </p>
